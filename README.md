## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend
- **Built with**: **Blazor WebAssembly** and **Bootstrap**.
- **State Management**: Utilizes **Fluxor** for state management.
- **UI Components**: Incorporates interactive components from **Radzen Blazor**.

### Backend
- **Technologies:** ASP.NET 6 Web API, Entity Framework Core 6, Microsoft Identity
- **Languages:** C#
- **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server for production; SQLite for development
- **Architecture Pattern:** Clean Architecture

The application follows **Clean Architecture** principles, organized into distinct layers to separate concerns and improve scalability.

- **Domain Layer**: Contains core entities and business rules specific to grain production and resource management.

- **Application Layer**: Manages the business logic, using **CQRS** to separate reads and writes, and **MediatR** for a decoupled command and query flow. **FluentValidation** handles validation to ensure consistent data input.

- **Infrastructure Layer**: Provides database access (SQL Server, SQLite for development) and integrates external services like **Microsoft Identity Server** for authentication.

- **WebAPI Layer**: Exposes RESTful endpoints to connect the frontend and backend, with **Swagger** for easy API documentation.
